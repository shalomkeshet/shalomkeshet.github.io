## Overview

My academic interests lie at the intersection of mathematics, computation, and physics. I enjoy building mathematical structure, using computation to formalize and test ideas, and applying these tools to physical modeling and real-world systems. Across competitions, computing challenges, and innovation projects, I have focused on reasoning from first principles and identifying underlying structure.

## Mathematics & problem-solving

I have developed my mathematical thinking primarily through olympiad-style problem solving and team-based competitions, which emphasized creativity, rigor, and persistence.

- **Indian Olympiad Qualifier in Mathematics (IOQM)** — 2024, 2025  
- **Mathematics Olympiad at IIT Bombay — 2024**  
- **Purple Comet! Math Meet** — 2025  
  *High School Mixed Teams category*  
- **International Math Bowl** — 2025  
  *Finalist team*  
- **Iranian Combinatorics Olympiad** — 2024, 2025  
- **American Mathematics Contest 10 (AMC 10)** — 2024  
- **Aryabhata Ganit Challenge (CBSE)** — National level  

These experiences strengthened my ability to approach unfamiliar problems, communicate mathematical ideas clearly, and collaborate under time constraints.

## Physics-focused exploration

My interest in physics is closely tied to geometry, symmetry, and transformations. I have built a strong conceptual foundation in **classical mechanics, electromagnetism, optics, and modern physics**, using mathematically grounded approaches. I am particularly interested in translating physical phenomena into mathematical models, analyzing limiting cases, and identifying conserved quantities and invariant structures.

## Computing & algorithmic thinking

I have explored algorithmic and computational problem-solving through the **Indian Computing Olympiad (ICO)** pathway organized by **IARCS**, which emphasizes rigorous logical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.

- **Zonal Informatics Olympiad (ZIO)** — 2025  
  First-stage examination of the Indian Olympiad in Informatics, focused on algorithmic decomposition, correctness, and structured problem solving.

- **Zonal Computing Olympiad (ZCO)**  
  First-stage examination under the Indian Computing Olympiad framework, reinforcing discrete mathematics, logic, and computational reasoning.

- **The Factorial Force**  
  An advanced calculator designed to perform a wide range of mathematical computations, developed collaboratively with **Shalom Keshet** and **Shashvat Kumar**. The project emphasized clean algorithmic design, mathematical correctness, and extensibility.

- **Camp Google — Science & Technology Program** (2020)  
  Selected as a winner in an interdisciplinary STEM program emphasizing scientific inquiry and computational creativity.

## Applied systems, innovation & leadership

### **National Innovation and Entrepreneurial Olympiad (NIEO), IIT Madras (E-21)** — 2024  
**Plantopia: Your AI-Powered Plant Companion (Project Submission)**

As part of a team project, I worked on **Plantopia**, an AI-assisted plant-care system submitted to NIEO 2024. The project focused on problem decomposition, user-centered system design, and integrating image-based diagnostics with contextual care recommendations. We also explored how community feedback and expert input could improve decision quality and user confidence over time.

### **National Innovation and Entrepreneurial Olympiad (NIEO), IIT Madras (E-21)** — 2025  
**CADS-Agri (Confidence-Based Agricultural Decision System)**

Contributed to the product idea and developed a production-ready cross-platform system (web + iOS) implementing a **Detect → Verify → Decide** workflow. The system includes a rover-based crop-monitoring simulation, a Decision Confidence Index (DCI), and a human-in-the-loop approval mechanism.

## Reflection

Across mathematics, computing, and physics exploration, I have learned to approach problems structurally—seeking invariants, building general frameworks, and reasoning from first principles. One experience that reinforced my confidence in pursuing mathematically demanding, open-ended problems was being **waitlisted for PROMYS India 2025 while in Grade 8**, with encouragement to reapply in a later year. I now view mathematics, computation, and physics as deeply interconnected disciplines, where abstract theory informs computation and computation enables meaningful physical and real-world modeling.
