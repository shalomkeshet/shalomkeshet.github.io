## Research experience

I have worked on algebraic and analytic methods for transforming discrete and piecewise-defined mathematical structures into continuous, symbolically tractable forms. My research focuses on eliminating explicit case distinctions while preserving differentiability and enabling symbolic manipulation.

My work has involved:
- Algebraic and analytic transformations of piecewise-defined functions  
- Conditional operators and symbolic computation  
- Exploratory connections between discrete dynamical systems and continuous analytic models

### **A Novel Approach to Transforming Piecewise Functions** (2025)  
*Preprint: viXra:2507.0216*

In this work, I developed a unified algebraic and analytic framework for converting arbitrary piecewise-defined functions into single, differentiable closed-form expressions. The approach uses conditional function representations, a Kronecker-type operator, and smooth analytic transforms to remove explicit case distinctions.

The framework enables symbolic manipulation of functions traditionally defined by cases and is applied to problems in number theory, symbolic transformation, and an exploratory continuous formulation related to the Collatz iteration.

## Ongoing & in-progress work

### **Symbolic frameworks for conditional function representations**
I am continuing to develop operator-based methods for representing discontinuous or case-defined functions within continuous analytic settings. This work aims to formalize a symbolic calculus for conditional expressions with applications in analysis and number theory.

### **Geometrical and physical frameworks for portal-based spatial connectivity**
*Manuscript in preparation*

I am developing a mathematical and physical framework for modeling portal-based spatial mappings using rigid-motion isometries and graph-theoretic formalisms. The work formalizes portal pairs via geometric transformations, introduces locomotion-based portal dynamics, and characterizes invariant geometric loci arising from non-parallel portal configurations, with applications to kinematics and theoretical physics–inspired spatial models.
