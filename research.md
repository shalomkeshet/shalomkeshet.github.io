**A Novel Approach to Transforming Piecewise Functions** (2025)  
*viXra:2507.0216*  

Manuscript under review at *SIURO (SIAM Undergraduate Research Online)*.

This work introduces an algebraic and analytic framework for converting piecewise-defined functions into smooth, differentiable expressions using conditional representations and a Kronecker-type operator. The approach enables symbolic manipulation of functions traditionally defined by cases and is applied to problems in number theory, symbolic transformation, and an exploratory continuous formulation related to the Collatz iteration.

## Ongoing work

**Symbolic frameworks for conditional function representations**  
Development of generalized operator-based methods for representing and analyzing discontinuous or case-defined functions within continuous analytic settings.

**Geometrical and physical frameworks for portal-based spatial connectivity**  
Development of a unified mathematical and physical framework for modeling portal-like spatial mappings as rigid isometries between bounded warp regions. The work formalizes portal pairs via geometric transformations inspired by traversable-wormhole metrics, analyzes kinematic effects of repeated traversals in Newtonian and relativistic regimes, and characterizes invariant geometric loci arising from portal configurations.
