## Projects

### **CADS-Agri**  
**Confidence-Based Agricultural Decision System**

A confidence-driven agricultural decision-support demo simulating a rover-based crop monitoring workflow. The system generates a **Decision Confidence Index (DCI)** from uploaded rover scan images and produces confidence-weighted recommendations within a **Detect → Verify → Decide** pipeline, enabling explicit approval, rejection, and execution tracking.

**Core ideas:**  
decision confidence modeling · human-in-the-loop systems · explainable recommendations · workflow state tracking

**Key features:**  
zone-based monitoring · DCI scoring (0–100) · recommendation lifecycle (approve / reject / execute) · timeline history · responsive dashboard

**Tech stack (keywords):**  
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, React Router, responsive CSS  
- **Backend:** Serverless APIs (Vercel), Node.js  
- **Data & storage:** PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, Vercel Blob Storage  
- **System design:** monorepo architecture, REST APIs, confidence metrics
